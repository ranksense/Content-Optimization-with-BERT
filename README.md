# Content-Optimization-with-BERT
A notebook containing code to help with reorganizing your content in order to optimize it for **BERT** to achieve **better SEO results**.

## The Purpose
* The purpose of this code is to test **Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT)** in order to understand how BERT answers questions given context.
* Furthermore, we can see how the use of **embedding** helps with analyzing the similarity of words with and without context.

## What does it do?
* Using the text from your webpage as context, the code uses BERT in order to answer any given question pertaining to the text.
* The output contains the answer, the level of confidence (score), and the starting and ending indices in the source context.
* Given a list of words or sentences, we can view the level of similarity between the words, **with or without context**.

## Practical usage
* You can use this code in order to **optimize your content for search questions using deep learning**.
* Since Bing and other major search engines are using BERT, you can use the script for SEO on your web pages containing the **most valuable information**. 
* By using frequently asked questions by your users, you can test whether BERT can extract the best answers from your page.
* If you run the script on your page and a competing page, you can compare the scores and reorganize the content on your page to optimize it for BERT and gain a competitive edge.
